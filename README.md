# github-battle

This is a fun project where you can see most popular repositories and Compare two users (let's say battle between two users ;) )

To see in action, please visit - https://react-project-one-github-battle.netlify.app/

This project is created while I was exploring react ecosystem (Including hooks, router v4, redux etc..,)

This repository has diffrent branches:
1) **main** - uses just basic react with react-router v4.
2) **use_react_hooks** - as name says, it uses react hooks everywhere. i.e.., Farewell Class Components ðŸ˜­ and Welcome Functional Components ðŸ‘‹ 

# How to run?
1) npm install - this will install all the node modules.
2) npm run start - starts the application in development mode. Visit application at http://localhost:8080
3) npm run build - builds the application for production deploy.
