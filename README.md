This is a fun project where you can see most popular repositories and Compare two users (let's say battle between two users ;) )

To see in action, please visit - https://react-project-one-github-battle.netlify.app/

This project is created while I was exploring react ecosystem (Including hooks, router v4, redux etc..,)

This repository has diffrent branches:
1) **main** - uses typescript (I ðŸ’“ Types) with react hooks
2) **react_without_hooks** - as name says, it uses just normal react with regular class components and withot react hooks (it uses javascript)
3) **with_hooks_js** - It uses hooks but written in java script.

# How to run?
1) npm install - this will install all the node modules.
2) npm run start - starts the application in development mode. Visit application at http://localhost:8080
3) npm run build - builds the application for production deploy.
